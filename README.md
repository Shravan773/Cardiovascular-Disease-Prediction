# Heart Disease Detection System

## Overview
This project is a heart disease detection system developed using Python and tkinter for the user interface. It utilizes machine learning techniques, particularly an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various medical parameters. The dataset used for training the ANN has been collected from nearest hospitals in India.

## Features
- User-friendly interface developed with tkinter.
